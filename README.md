<p>A collection of projects I made for Codecademy's Full-Stack Developer career path. These are challenges that go off-platform and start from scratch.</p>

<p>Instead of downloading the projects, you can use <a href="https://htmlpreview.github.io/">https://htmlpreview.github.io/</a>. Click on a project you want to view then the HTML file. In the top right, click on the three dots for more file actions. Then select 'Copy permalink'. Go to <a href="https://htmlpreview.github.io/">https://htmlpreview.github.io/</a> and paste in the link.</p>
